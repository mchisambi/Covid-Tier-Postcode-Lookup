# Covid-Tier-Postcode-Lookup
In response to the ongoing pandemic the UK Govt set up a tier system based on risk. The system has four tiers (22 Dec 2020). The UK Government has a website that lets you look up what tier you are in based on postcode but that is only one postcode at a time. Using the government website (https://www.gov.uk/find-coronavirus-local-restrictions), this code lets you upload a csv file of postcodes then creates a new csv which matches those postcodes to their relevant tier.
