# Covid-Tier-Postcode-Lookup
In response to the ongoing pandemic the UK Government set up a tier system for England. The system has four tiers (22 Dec 2020). 

The UK Government has a website that lets you look up what tier you are in based on postcode but you can only do it one one postcode at a time. 

Using the government website (https://www.gov.uk/find-coronavirus-local-restrictions), this program lets you upload a csv file of postcodes then creates a new csv which matches those postcodes to their relevant tier. Potentially helpful for small businesses who may need to look at multiple postcodes.
